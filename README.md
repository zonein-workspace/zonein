# Zonein – On-chain Trading OS for Solana

**Zonein** is an agentic Trading OS that helps traders cut through data overload and act early on high-conviction opportunities. Instead of juggling fragmented tools, Zonein delivers insights, recommendations, and on-chain actions in one continuous OODA loop.

## The Problem
Trading on Solana moves faster than humans can react:

- **63M+ daily transactions** and **21M+ weekly active addresses**  
- **$879M+ daily volume on Jupiter**  
- **293,192 tokens launched in 2 weeks on Pump.fun**, with **$1.02B daily volume**

Existing systems are fragmented and slow — traders must switch between research, alerts, execution, and tooling, causing delays, missed metas, and poor conviction.

## Our Solution
Zonein unifies **AI research, trader intelligence, and on-chain execution** into a single agentic OS powered by a 24/7 OODA loop:

**Observe → Orient → Decide → Act** 

- *Observe:* Blockchain, market, and social signals  
- *Orient:* Deep Intel + Trader Atlas for context and strategy  
- *Decide:* High-conviction, explainable recommendations  
- *Act:* One-click or automated execution via WebApp / Telegram / Extension
